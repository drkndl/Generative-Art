# Generative-Art

This repository contains my generative art scripts. They have been created with Processing for Python, R and pycairo. Note that most of the scripts may not be efficient since these are my first attempts at learning Generative Art and I am still finding the right language for me. The idea for creating generative art was inspired by [Generative Art Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk&t=1137s) by Tim Holman.
