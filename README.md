# Generative-Art-with-ProcessingPy

This repository contains my generative art scripts created with Processing for Python. Note that most of the scripts may not be efficient since these are my first attempts at learning ProcessingPy. The idea for creating generative art was inspired by [Generative Art Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk&t=1137s) by Tim Holman. I took help from [Generative Artistry tutorials](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/) (written in JavaScript) to write my code.
